# Two types of tests:
#
# 1. shell tests run using bats
# 2. build tests also run using bats
#
# Shell tests are run unconditionally on Linux (see jobs.include).
#
# Build tests can be skipped by starting the commit message with
# '[skip build]'.
#
# Build tests are run on platforms generated from all combinations
# of keys below.
