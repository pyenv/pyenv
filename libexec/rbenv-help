Some useful rbenv commands are:
   commands      List all commands
   rehash        Rehash rbenv shims (run this after installing binaries)
   global        Set or show the global Ruby version
   local         Set or show the local directory-specific Ruby version
   shell         Set or show the shell-specific Ruby version
   version       Show the current Ruby version
   versions      List all Ruby versions known by rbenv

See 'rbenv help <command>' for more information on a specific command.

global) echo "usage: rbenv global <version>

Sets the global Ruby version. You can override the global version at
any time by setting a directory-specific version with \`rbenv local'
or by setting the RBENV_VERSION environment variable.

$(print_set_version)"
;;
local) echo "usage: rbenv local <version>
       rbenv local --unset

Sets the local directory-specific Ruby version by writing the version
name to a file named '.rbenv-version'.

When you run a Ruby command, rbenv will look for an '.rbenv-version'
file in the current directory and each parent directory. If no such
file is found in the tree, rbenv will use the global Ruby version
specified with \`rbenv global', or the version specified in the
RBENV_VERSION environment variable.

$(print_set_version)"
;;
shell) echo "usage: rbenv shell <version>
       rbenv shell --unset

Sets a shell-specific Ruby version by setting the 'RBENV_VERSION'
environment variable in your shell. This version overrides both
project-specific versions and the global version.
