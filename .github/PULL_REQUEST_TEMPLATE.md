### Prerequisite
* [ ] Please consider implementing the feature as a hook script or plugin as a first step.
  * pyenv has some powerful support for plugins and hook scripts. Please refer to [Authoring plugins](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Authoring-plugins) for details and try to implement it as a plugin if possible.
* [ ] Please consider contributing the patch upstream to [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), since we have borrowed most of the code from this project.
  * We are occasionally importing the changes from rbenv. In general, you can expect some changes made in rbenv will be imported to pyenv too, eventually.
  * Generally speaking, we sometimes don't prefer to make some change in the core to keep compatibility with rbenv.
